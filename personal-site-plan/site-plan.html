      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
Home page: As a home page, here I’m gonna sell and offer my services creating websites for any users or companies.
 No matter the size of the company, but it’s very important to call attention for the audience I expect
  to have as clients. I’m planning to create some sections in the body of my home page explaining what 
  kind of webpages are my specialties, or in which I’m better. Also I’m planning to create some templates
   or “pre visualization” of style of webpages I offer or I have done before. In this way I’m drawing the 
   attention of new users and possible clients, and at the same time, I’m doing my site different than others.
    At the final of the page I’m thinking about to show an option via chat in live. The most important part if
     this home page is to give the right options for all the services I offer. The less you want to do is 
     confused to clients because this can generate a problem and you can lose possible clients, and you’ll 
     limit the capacity for growth of your business.

      </ul>
      <h3>Question Page</h3>
      <p>
As you know, people maybe have any question. For that reason I want to provide a page were every user looking 
for information, client or company with any question can have a place where they can ask and receive and answer
 for their question. I’m thinking to put a list of common question you may have, and another option when you 
 can ask me a question about anything. In case if you don’t find a question you wanted to get an answer. Also 
 maybe provide a little, basic guide in case of any problem you can find about the function of my home page.
 I was thinking to create a section where I can explain different tools of my webpage. The main purpose of 
 this page is to give support to the client or user. It’s a good way I see where people can ask their doubts,
 and at the same time it’s different than other pages because as a webpage that offer a service, it’s important 
 to have an exclusive place for question.  According to the pass of the time I can improve basic question, and 
 improve the information here for the clients. But, it’s necessary to give user basic information of what they’ll 
 do if they go in this page.

      </ul>
      <h3>Comments page</h3>
      <p>
        I have been able to see in another pages and application that people really care the rate of the service
         or application. According to this, the webpage can growth more and, that means more clients too. Also, 
         the comments and opinions of people can help you to improve your service with new ideas or take off some
          option and tools. So, I want to give to clients a place where they can share their experiences and also
         they talk about the quality of the job they received. So, a qualification of 5 stars or put something like
          “in a scale from 1 to 10, what would be your qualification? And a block of text where they can write its
           ok I think so or whatever they think. I want my webpage can stand out among another webpages, and this
            is a good way I think it can do it.
